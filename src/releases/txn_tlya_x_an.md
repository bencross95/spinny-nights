**Artist**: Tlya X An\
**Release Title**: TXN

Bringing a heady cocktail of hyperpop, early-2000s R&B, trap and deconstructed club music, Tlya X An's debut EP TXN is simply united by feeling so damn good. Tlya's instinctive approach to melody and production mean that every minor detail hits exactly where you want it to, while still feeling starkly new. Each ad lib and synth line hits like a drop of sherbet on your tongue, with her saccharine sense for melody perfectly balanced by a menacing sense of humor.

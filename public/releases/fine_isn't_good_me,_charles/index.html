    <h2>Release Information</h2>
<p><strong>Artist</strong>: Me, Charles<br>
<strong>Release Title</strong>: Fine Isn't Good</p>
<p>Me, Charles’ debut EP is a groundbreaking and experimental fusion of warped jazz, glitchy electronics and chamber instrumentation. The project as a whole is pitched as a heightened and feverish art piece, drawing on Charles’ experiences of loss, disordered eating and struggles with addiction, through a sardonic and surrealist lens in which Me, Charles comes across, in his own words, as “a bit of an idiot”.</p>

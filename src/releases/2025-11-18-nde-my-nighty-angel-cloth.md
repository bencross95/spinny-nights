"My Nighty<angel cloth>," is described by Mona as “a song about a nightie angel that wants to be worn by the life of a body.” When asked about their new song NDE, Robbie explains “it’s a sad song about wanting to be somewhere else. The reference to volcanoes comes from our love of Werner Herzogs’ ‘The Fire Within’, which documents Katia and Maurice Kraffts obsession with volcanoes. The archive narratively and aesthetically set the backdrop for the song's creation.” Both songs playfully and emotionally center themselves around life’s physicality and the enigma of death.

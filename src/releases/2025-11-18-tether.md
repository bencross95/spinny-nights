‘Tether’ builds from a place of choral tranquility towards frantic resolution, the breakbeats at the heart of the song surrounding the listener within a circle of unwavering chaos as they thrash towards breaking point. Washed out, saturated textures collide with the tightness and rigidity of an underlying drum and bass sensibility to create waves of soaring, dreamlike catharsis. The song is underpinned by a poem written by the artist - *“a cursed frame — untethered from the earth awaken, drifting ceaselessly…”* - and reflect upon the experiential disconnection from reality which arises at times of great uncertainty. “TETHER is about that feeling of becoming distant from your own reality- like losing your sense of control, being swept away by everything happening around you.”

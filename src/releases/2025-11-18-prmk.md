‘prmrk’ is the latest EP from sound artist, composer & film music editor William Carkeet. Known for his role in the art pop duo Robbie & Mona and his work with composer Jerskin Fendrix (Poor Things, Kinds of Kindness & Bugonia), William now releases a strikingly atmospheric collection of organ compositions, recorded in an empty derelict Primark building on Margate High Street. 

In the new EP ‘prmrk’, William embraces the raw sonic character of both the organ and its decaying surroundings. Steering clear of unnecessary complexity, he sought to capture sound in its purest form, allowing the instrument and space to guide the projects direction while refraining from incorporating additional elements into the compositions.. The resulting compositions are haunting, intimate, and deeply resonant, with the natural acoustics of the abandoned retail space adding an eerily satisfying coldness to the music.

By experimenting with recording at low quality recording and different sample rates, William intentionally introduced audio artifacts creating sonic imperfections that mirror the building’s dilapidated appeal. This approach transforms ‘prmrk’ into more than just an organ EP; it is a document of place and time, an exploration of sound in movememt. To further this documentation of the primark space William is releasing a DIY reverb plug in that comes with the CD. which includes an audio file of a frequency sweep William recorded in the derelict space and instructions of how add this too a reverb plug-in a music software. Enabling the audience to explore this space with their own sounds.

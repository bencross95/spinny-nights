## Release Information

**Artist**: Silkarmour  
**Release Title**: Folk

Silkarmour is an explorative musical project created by London-based producer and musician Enzo Samuel. Shifting aliases and formats over the last decade, the artist credits his obsessive, perfectionist tendencies as the force behind his deeply layered compositions. His latest track ‘Folk’ explores the fashion of anonymity and references the 2002 documentary ‘Tokyo Noise’.

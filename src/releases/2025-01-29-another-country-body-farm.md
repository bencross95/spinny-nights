‘BODY FARM’, the new EP from electronic duo Another; Country $$$$, is a rippling mosaic of a project; one that manages to skilfully merge melancholic piano sequences with frenetic breakcore live drums and folding ambient post-rock introspections with UKG bassline. Features collaborators BUFFEE, Elsa Hewitt and Crimewave who each bring their own unique twist to 'BODY FARM'. 

The title refers to research facilities where the decomposition of humans is studied and analysed. This ostensibly macabre reference has layered depths, with the duo describing how these facilities ‘felt reflective of the cyclical period of reflection and analysis incurred by grief’. The song seems almost locked into a turbulent search for itself, its rhythmic body continually rupturing and then reforming in a transmutation that the pair locate as ‘a certain feeling of mania & euphoria found while searching for new meanings’.

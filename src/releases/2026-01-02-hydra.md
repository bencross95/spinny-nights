After two years of personal distress, reflection, and rebirth, these two weighty, 70bpm punk-infused industrial tracks are born of potent hope. BREAK A SWEAT is the warrior’s journey against apathy - a confrontation with the Western world’s ongoing colonial violence in Palestine, Sudan, and Congo. BABYLON ROTTEN is the rallying cry: a call to reclaim inner and collective power against the many-headed beast of government corruption that defines this dark era.

This corruption reflects a deeper sickness of humanity - where lies spread like wildfire, life is cheapened, and division and censorship thrive in poisoned yet fertile soil. The important caveat is that Hercules didn’t defeat the Hydra alone; he worked with Iolaus, who cauterised each wound to stop new heads from growing.

Since my last release, I’ve been on my own journey of strength - physically, through strength training and recovery from knee surgery, and spiritually, through deeper self-connection and activism. Now I feel rooted, rebellious, and ready to connect and agitate, and I sense that same readiness in the collective.

Over this time I’ve also honed my production craft, collaborating with key figures from Bristol’s experimental jam scene - Michael Gianan on guitar (BABYLON ROTTEN), EJ:AKIN on vocals and James Storm on saxophone (BREAK A SWEAT).

These two tracks are galvanising sonic odysseys that open the next chapter. It’s time for us to tap into the Herculean - to get uncomfortable, to get moving, and to start swinging.

An infectious rampage through her trademark industrial soundscapes, the 'Heaven' sees BUFFEE embracing the thrilling hedonism of sultry vocal hooks and four-to-the-floor kicks.[ ](https://soundcloud.com/buffeemusic/heaven/s-26h0ZUt3Kwg?si=08d33c80def949f9abfee692c019fccf&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)Rattling through a blizzard of crunchy samples and throbbing bass, ‘Heaven’ is BUFFEE’s most pure-pop release to date, perfectly balancing euphoria and melancholy. On the track, BUFFEE offers: “‘Heaven’ is an ode to a maximalist approach to mixing, and producing in the bedroom. It’s also Frankenstein's monster of several songs I wrote, drawn together. It’s a hollow crunchy shell of a song held together by pop conventions and fun.“

<p><strong>Artist</strong>: Robbie &amp; Mona<br>
<strong>Release Title</strong>: EW</p>
<p>Robbie &amp; Mona is couple-duet, William Carkeet and Eleanor Gray, who have found a surreal creative outlet making their gorgeous scrap-book glitch pop with each other. Their debut album ‘EW’ experiments fearlessly with sonic textures and song structures, expertly toeing the line between deep emotional resonance and alienating disarray.</p>

**Artist**: Park Motive  
**Release Title**: Duuust

It is rare for a debut release to arrive with such unabashed intention, but Park Motive’s circuit-board symphonies have had more than enough incubation time. The songs on debut EP ‘Duuust’ have had various incarnations since Sam Herschmann’s beginnings playing underage parties in London in the mid 2010s, with the current six-piece line-up bringing an organic frenzy to his meticulous productions.

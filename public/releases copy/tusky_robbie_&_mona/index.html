<p><strong>Artist</strong>: Robbie &amp; Mona<br>
<strong>Release Title</strong>: Tusky</p>
<p>On their sophomore effort Tusky, surrealist duet Robbie &amp; Mona ascend beyond the lo-fi scrawlings of their debut album to something altogether more grandiose. Between the lights down drama of sprawling opener ‘Sensation’, to the ‘roll credits’ coda of closer ‘Always Gonna Be A Dead Man’, Tusky exists as a glitzy, lucid journey playing out before the listener.</p>

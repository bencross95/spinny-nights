Crimewave hot off tours with Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon and George Clanton collaborates with up and coming Manchester experimentalists Another Country $$$$ on track 'Body Farm //' a gritty and warped song which combines the delicate brilliance of guitars with distortion and glitch, skilfully pairing it against cascading drum breaks to build to fracturing climaxes. Inspired by the usual sound palette of IDM, shoegaze and electronica that Crimewave often pulls from, this track is left-field and thrilling.

The title refers to research facilities where the decomposition of humans is studied and analysed. This ostensibly macabre reference has layered depths, with the duo describing how these facilities ‘felt reflective of the cyclical period of reflection and analysis incurred by grief’. The song seems almost locked into a turbulent search for itself, its rhythmic body continually rupturing and then reforming in a transmutation that the pair locate as ‘a certain feeling of mania & euphoria found while searching for new meanings’.

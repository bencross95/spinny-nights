BUFFEE returns with emotionally catastrophic and uplifting “EP2”. BUFFEE’s second collection of work sees a partial departure from the claustrophobia of last year’s “Victory Lap” while continuing to use the “auspiciously unconventional and idiosyncratic production techniques” METAL MAG that define her sound. Songs take place in disparate yet connected settings; in the heat of sun on the street, the darkness of the club,  inner sanctum of a bedroom and further into BUFFEE’s own head. The voice and the sounds that surround it are given more space leading to a more expansive sound. The direct influence of songs developed in a live setting, time spent re-working sounds in various DIY spaces now stretching out it’s limbs in EP2 with a collection that is equal parts emotional and warm as it is harsh and heavy.

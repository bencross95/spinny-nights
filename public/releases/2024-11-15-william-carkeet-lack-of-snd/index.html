                <p>William Carkeet of Robbie &amp; Mona created the initial form of this EP during a period of difficulty sleeping, so he decided to create soothing, engulfing music to aid some kind of beautiful slumber for anyone who needed it.</p>
<p>During the making of his EP, William was exploring the idea of making “music” from silence. He says he was intrigued by the idea of sonic nothingness and how this could be a form of sound creation. An illustrative example can be found in the Single &quot;congratulations,&quot; where a sound emerges halfway through—a sample he created by extracting the gaps (silences) between the words as he read a section from John Cage's book, &quot;Silence.&quot;</p>
<p>Initially, this approach was created with a touch of ironic humour, but as it evolved, it took on a compelling quality that encouraged him to pursue further across the EP, using field recordings, recording techniques and inaudible frequencies.</p>

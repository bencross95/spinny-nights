To feel awestruck is to feel profound amazement, wonder or fear, The duo once again return to the hypnotic sonic realm they inhabit so uniquely, now framed through the imagery and metaphor of Halloween. Referencing old pregnancies and spirits in the womb, it is “inspired by the blood, lust, tactility and transformation felt during menstruation…a sort of turn-on, by the world.’” Awestruck was born in the storm-swept countryside of France within a house steeped in witchy lore, its creation unfolding amid thunder, rain, and the sessions for their third album. The lyrics, written long before, seemed to rise up, finding their moment at last while the music unfolded with a brooding, possessive rhythm. Driving back to the UK, they stopped for food in a remote area and the first restaurant they found was called La Gourmandise - a name that appeared in the song’s lyrics, playing a serendipitous role in the confirmation of the song.

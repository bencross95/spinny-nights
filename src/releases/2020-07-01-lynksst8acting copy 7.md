 A scolding critique of a ‘masc4masc’, straight-worshipping trend proliferating in queer culture. [Listen here](https://open.spotify.com/track/7g1R3Hd3BmYtTE1j4Jlsyi?si=2d17072188544759).

A performer, an entrepreneur, and now a religion∗, Lynks is set for world domination. Written on the long walk home from a sweaty, sticky, sexually-predatory straight-club, ‘Str8 Acting’ is a frenetic deconstruction of club music, all held together by Lynk’s urgent confessions. The track has since been re-released, but we are proud to have started the label with such a bang.

∗ disciples include Elton John

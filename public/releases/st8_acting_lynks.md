## Release Information

**Artist**: Lynks  
**Release Title**: St8 Acting

A performer, an entrepreneur, and now a religion, Lynks is set for world domination. ‘Str8 Acting’ is a frenetic deconstruction of club music, all held together by Lynk’s urgent confessions. The track has since been re-released, but we are proud to have started the label with such a bang.

More information about the release here if needed.

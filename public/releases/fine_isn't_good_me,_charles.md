**Artist**: Me, Charles\
**Release Title**: Fine Isn't Good

Me, Charles’ debut EP is a groundbreaking and experimental fusion of warped jazz, glitchy electronics and chamber instrumentation. The project as a whole is pitched as a heightened and feverish art piece, drawing on Charles’ experiences of loss, disordered eating and struggles with addiction, through a sardonic and surrealist lens in which Me, Charles comes across, in his own words, as “a bit of an idiot”.

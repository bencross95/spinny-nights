“BREAKING A SWEAT IS DISCOMFORT.

BREAKING A SWEAT IS STRENGTH & FITNESS.

BREAKING A SWEAT IS MASS DISOBEDIENCE.

BREAKING A SWEAT IS FUTURE LIBERATION.

Making this song was a reminder for me to persevere. To keep moving, no matter how small the steps. The future is both bleak and bright, and there’s little chance in what it ends up being, only its price in sweat.

This is a deep appreciation for resistance movements globally. May the oppressors never know peace.“

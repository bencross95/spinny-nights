**Artist**: Robbie & Mona  
**Release Title**: EW

Robbie & Mona is couple-duet, William Carkeet and Eleanor Gray, who have found a surreal creative outlet making their gorgeous scrap-book glitch pop with each other. Their debut album ‘EW’ experiments fearlessly with sonic textures and song structures, expertly toeing the line between deep emotional resonance and alienating disarray.

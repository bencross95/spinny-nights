CURSED FRAME refers both “to the body and the screen. It’s sort of a conscious reference drawing from the language of old horror games like Fatal Frame— as well as the idea of carrying, your own body or your frame- that’s afflicted, dragging itself through a curse. It’s about the residue of experience, the way memory stains us, the way images and screens trap fragments of ourselves.” Culmination of countless revisions through process of experimentation in the underground scene, Cursed Frame inspired by J horror: co-existence of beauty and resentment, appreciation for melancholy and beauty interwoven. Particularly inspired by the movie pulse - the plot follows ghosts invading the living world via the Internet. How the people pass away and their residue stays here- they create a stain. “I was inspired by Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s Pulse—the way ghosts invade the living world through the internet, leaving behind stains, residues, traces of themselves. That visual grammar really stuck with me. I wanted the visuals to feel like software—something connective, like different computers carrying and spreading a curse. The accompanying poem functions like a spell.”
